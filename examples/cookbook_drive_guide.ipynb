The address would be something like \"Zijingang Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China\". Similarly, for Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport, the address is \"Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Hangzhou, China\".\n",

      "Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a direct function for distance between two addresses. But looking at the available tools, the maps_distance function requires coordinates. So first, I need to get the coordinates for both places.\n",

      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "1. Use maps_geo for Zijingang Campus to get its latitude and longitude.\n",
      "2. Use maps_geo for Xiaoshan Airport to get its coordinates.\n",
      "3. Then use maps_distance with the obtained coordinates, specifying type 1 for driving distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I can't perform multiple function calls in one response, I need to handle this step by step. However, the user's query might expect a single answer. Wait, in the tools provided, there's the maps_distance function which can take origins and destination. But origins can be multiple, but here we need just one origin and one destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "So first, I need to get the coordinates for both locations. Let me start by calling maps_geo for Zijingang Campus.\n",

      "But the user's question is straightforward, so maybe there's a way to chain these calls. But according to the instructions, each turn the assistant can call one function.

But since each tool call is separate, perhaps the assistant needs to make multiple steps.\n",
